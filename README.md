This Repository is about a new approach related to Hybrid Time Series modeling.

This repository introduces a new univariate time series modeling approach for the data Climate Change Time Series Data. The new method uses nine different models while constructing the final model. Throughout the analyses, R-Studio is used.

In Hybrid-Modeling.html file, tutorial codes are given with their output. In that tutorial, Climate Change data is used.

In hybrid-approach.pdf file, a paper is written so that the method is shared more in detail. In that paper, Unemployment Rate data for U.S (UNRATE) is used.
